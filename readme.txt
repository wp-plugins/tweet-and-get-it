= Which file types can I share via my Tweet & Get it buttons ? =

Tweet & Get it ! is fully recommended to share content such as :
Music, Documents, Promotional Codes, Coupons, Ebooks, Photos, Wallpapers, Typography, CMS Themes, Videos, Software, Tutorials, Web Resources, Icons, PSD brushes ...
There is no restriction to which file types you can share. The maximum weigh of the file is set in your server configuration (max_upload_size in your php.ini file). Contact your server admin if you want to increase your maximum upload size.

= Is Tweet & Get it entirely for free ? =

Yes, Tweet & Get it ! is a 100% free service.

= How many Tweet&Get it buttons can I create ? =

You can create as many buttons as you want. 

= Is it possible to use a different Twitter account per button? =

Yes, of course!

= Is it possible to configure a different promotional Tweet per button ? =

Yes, of course !  

= Is it possible to provide a file to via an URL that's external to my WordPress site? =
It is indeed possible. You can upload a file from your hard drive or just give the URL of your file's location.

= I can't upload my file, what now? =
Check if Safe Mode is OFF in your server configuration. If you can't turn it off or if you don't want to mess with it, you can create a tweetandgetit folder manually in your WordPress Uploads. http://myblog/wp-content/uploads/tweetandgetit
The folder has to be created with 777 chmod permission. Now you should be able to create your Tweet&Get it buttons!

= Safe mode is OFF but I still can't upload my files. What can I do ? =

Check if there's a folder called Uploads in your WordPress blog. http://myblog/wp-content/uploads/ If this folder doesn't exist you have to give the wp-content folder 777 permission, so that the Tweet & Get it plugin can create the "uploads" folder it needs.
